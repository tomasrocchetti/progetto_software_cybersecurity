### Usage instructions for dummies

Install [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=it) from Chrome extensions store

In Metamask go to ```settings > network > Add a network```:
Network name: my network

Now you can import some addresses from the chain to Metamask, these are some private keys for importing:
