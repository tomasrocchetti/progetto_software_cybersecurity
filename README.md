### Usage instructions for dummies

Install [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=it) from Chrome extensions store

In Metamask go to ```settings > network > Add a network``` and use the following settings:  
**Network name:** my network  
**URL RPC:** 192.168.1.50:7545  
**Chain ID:** 1337

Now you can import some addresses from the chain to Metamask, these are some private keys for importing:
